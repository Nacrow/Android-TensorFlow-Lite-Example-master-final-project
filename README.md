# Edge Computer Vision Application - Melanoma Classification
* This is an example project for integrating [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/mobile/tflite/) into Android application
* This project includes a model used to classify Melanoma. It is trained by GCP AutoML Vision.
* [Traning Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/andrewmvd/isic-2019) is from kaggle including 8 types of skin lesion. 
* This project is based on [Android TensorFlow Lite Machine Learning Example](https://github.com/amitshekhariitbhu/Android-TensorFlow-Lite-Example).
